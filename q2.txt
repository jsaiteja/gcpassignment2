
 Configuring stack driver monitoring on aws ec2 instance

1. Create a new GCP project

2. go to Stack driver monitoring and create a new workspace

3. Add the GCP project to the newly created workspace and 
   also click on add AWS account.

4. Record the External ID and Account ID as it is required to create AWS role.

5. Create a role with Read only access and copy its arn and paste in the workspace.
   Now aws account is also added to the workspace.

6. after successful addition of AWS account, monitoring gives the message that 
   the aws account is linked to aws connector(aws-23...)

7. Create a Service account to authorize the stack driver and in the roles 
   add Monitoring metric writer and Log writer.Also generate the key and save it.

8. To add a service account, do the following:

    a. copy the Stackdriver private-key credentials file to  AWS EC2 instance and save it 
        in a file named temp.json. In the scp command, specify the path to key.pem, your AWS SSH key pair file, and provide your AWS credentials:
       CREDS="Downloads/Saiteja-stackdriver-5567884.json"
       KEY="Downloads/instancekey.pem"
       scp -i "$KEY" "$CREDS" ec2-user@34.12.45.32:temp.json


    b. On your EC2 instance, move the credentials to /etc/google/auth/application_default_credentials.json:

       GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/etc/google/auth/application_default_credentials.json"
       sudo mkdir -p $(dirname "$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS")
       sudo mv "$HOME/temp.json" "$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS" 

9. Install Stackdriver monitoring and logging agents using the following commands

   curl -sSO https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/install-monitoring-agent.sh
   sudo bash install-monitoring-agent.sh

   curl -sSO https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/install-logging-agent.sh
   sudo bash install-logging-agent.sh --structured

10. Using Stack driver services with AWS, Create an up-time check.

11. Create an alerting policy by adding the notification channel.

12. Go to Logging and to view the logs, select the GCP project and AWS link
