
1. Create a new cloud function, specify the name.

2. Select Cloud Storage in the trigger.Enter the bucket name in which the file will be uploaded to detect objects.
   Set language to Python 3.7

vision_client = vision.ImageAnnotatorClient()
def detect_objects(file, context):
   bucket = file['bucket']
   filename = file['name']
   print('Looking for objects in image {}'.format(filename))
   try:
       objects = vision_client.object_localization({
           'source': {'image_uri': 'gs://{}/{}'.format(bucket, filename)}
       }).localized_object_annotations
       print('Number of objects found: {}'.format(len(objects)))
       for object_ in objects:
           print('\n{} (confidence: {})'.format(object_.name, object_.score))
   except:
       print("Error")

4. Logs can be viewed using the view logs tab in the Stackdriver.
   It has all the names of the objects that are detected when an image is uploaded to a GCS bucket.
