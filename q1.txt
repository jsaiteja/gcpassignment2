1. Go to Compute Engine VM instance in the gcp console

2. Create an instance. Specify the name, region as us-east1

3. In order to create an instance with only private ip, go to network,Vpc part and keep the external ip as none

4. Also create another instance which has both private and external ip.

5. Ensure that the both instances are present in the same vpc.

6. Give network tag to the instance, Create Cloud NAT in that vpc to access internet.

7. SSH the instance with external ip

8. Execute  ssh private-instance-name to launch the private instance 

   For eg. sai-gcp-3 is my gce vm instance with only private ip
           gcp2-sai-q1 is my instance having external ip also
  launch gcp2-sai-q1 using SSH and execute the command ssh sai-gcp-3 to launch private instance. Before that, Cloud NAT has created.

9. Check whether the private ip instance is able to access internet by some commands like curl example.com
