
1. Create a gcp VM instance using the console.

2. Specify the name,zone as us-east1

3. While creating in the firewalls enable the http and https traffic.

4. Also write the start up script at its place while creating so that whenever an instance is stopped and started,
   the start up script works and apache will be installed.
   My start up displays a name whenver it is accessed. It is as follows:

   #! /bin/bash
    sudo su
    apt-get install w3m w3m-img
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y apache2
    echo "<h1>Hello Saiteja</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html

5. After creation of the instance go to vpc-> firewall rule.
   Add the external ip of this instance to the source ip range in the firewall rules
   so that it can be accessed in the browser by the link 
   http://[External_ip]

6. By opening it through http or https link the name will be displayed.

7. In order to stop and restart the vm instance using the cli use the following commands

   gcloud compute instances stop gcp-instance1
   gcloud compute instances start gcp-instance1

8. After restarting also when we access it using http link the message will be displayed since a start up script is written.
